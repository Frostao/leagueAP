# League of Legends API Challenge 2.0 Entry -- League of Legends AP Item Change Analysis


By Zhen Chen and Kartik Yadav. 

This is a project build for the League of Legends API Challenge 2.0 problem two which is 

*Given two data sets of match IDs, one before the AP Item changes and another one after, create a piece of software to demonstrate changes in AP Item usage.*

What we did was using the match IDs which were provided to retrieve the champion information from Riot's API. For each match, we found the top four most magic damage dealt champion and record their kills, deaths, wins and most importantly, their items. Then we present those information we got in a AngularJS Application.

There is separate documentation in each necessary folder.
