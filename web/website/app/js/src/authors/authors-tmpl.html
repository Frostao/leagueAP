<div class="container" style="color: #FFFFFF;">
	<p>This application is designed for an entry to the Leguage of Legends API challenge 2.0</p>
	<p>It is not related to Riot Games in any ways.</p>
	<p>About 10000 matches were used for each region's mode patch 5.11 or patch 5.14</p>
	<p>The way we retrive data from riot's match API is to store the top four most magic damage dealt champion's data in a JSON</p>
	<p>In this JSON, we record kills, deaths, amount of games wins and frequency of those champions</p>
	<p>Those JSON are accessible in our repository.</p>
	<p>Then we present our data on this website</p>
